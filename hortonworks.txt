Since you're creating a larger cluster now, the NameNode needs more memory to keep track of the metadata than what you used in the previous lesson.
From your EC2 dashboard, launch an instance. Again, choose Ubuntu server. The t2.micro instance won't work anymore, instead, you should use m3.large since it has 7.5 GB of memory.
Just one instance is fine for now. Next, choose 30 GB of storage for the instance.
TAG it "Ambari server."
Then you're going to configure the security group. You'll need to add a rule to allow access to the Ambari web client. Add a Custom TCP Rule, set the port to 8080, and leave the source as all these zeros. Here
you'll be leaving it open to anyone. Typically you'd restrict the source address so that only your organization could access the client.
Finally, launch your instance! Again, you'll need a private key, you'll most likely want to use the one you created in the previous lesson. You should be able to select it from the drop down menu. If not, create a
new key and download it.
ssh -i /path/to/key_file.pem ubuntu@DNS_hostname
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install ntp -y
sudo service ntp status
sudo service ntp start
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

#Create SnapShot save the instance to an image, call it something like “Ambari

#You can easily create any number of nodes for our cluster by launching #instances
from the image you just created.
#Launch x number nodes or more for the cluster
