Disable selinux
One common reason to disable the firewall is, as we know HDFS maintains replication in different nodes/racks but it shouldn't take any extra time for that. Setting firewall using SElinux may disturb this (or) lead to performance issue. So the general recommendation is to disable the firewall. But I believe in some cases users are still using hadoop with firewall for security reasons (if the business really demands).

 

Regarding your question about security, you can follow the other recommended securities like kerberos, sentry, etc (depends upon your needs).

Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is a Linux memory management system that reduces the overhead of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups on machines with large amounts of memory by using larger memory pages.

However THP feature is known to perform poorly in Hadoop cluster and results in excessively high CPU utilization.

Disable THP to reduce the amount of system CPU utilization on your worker nodes.  This can be done by ensuring that both proc entries are set to [never] instead of [always].

Disabling Firewall is one of the major requirement while setting up the Firewall. Else you will need to manually unblock many ports.

For Ambari to communicate during setup with the hosts it deploys to and manages, certain ports must be open and available. The easiest way to do this is to temporarily disable iptables, as follows:

# systemctl disable firewalld
# service firewalld stop
You can restart iptables after setup is complete. If the security protocols in your environment prevent disabling iptables, you can proceed with iptables enabled, if all required ports are open and available.

Ambari checks whether iptables is running during the Ambari Server setup process. If iptables is running, a warning displays, reminding you to check that required ports are open and available. The Host Confirm step in the Cluster Install Wizard also issues a warning for each host that has iptables running.
